## Visual Tracer
The Visual Tracer extension for Grasshopper is a revolutionary tool for the analysis and visualization of spatial visual qualities within digital environments. Compatible with Unity and Unity VR, as well as upcoming VR and AR systems such as Apple VR and Microsoft Hololens, Visual Tracer allows for the collection of data on user preferences and behavior within a given space, providing an unparalleled level of insight into the spatial qualities of a given environment.

The key features of Visual Tracer is its ability to quantify the attractiveness of space and generate heatmaps to visualize this attractiveness, providing a clear and easy-to-understand representation of user preferences for surfaces, directions, and spaces. These heatmaps allow for informed decisions about the placement and arrangement of elements within a digital environment, leading to the creation of more immersive and engaging experiences for users. Additionally, by providing an intuitive understanding of the spatial qualities of a given environment, Visual Tracer facilitates efficient and effective design decisions at the early stages of the design process, saving valuable time and resources.

Visual Tracer can be applied at various scales, from the interior to the urban scale, and has the potential to revolutionize research in fields such as Praxeology, architecture, urban planning, and game design. In particular, the ability of Visual Tracer to quantify the attractiveness of space can be used to study the relationship between human behavior and the physical and aesthetic qualities of a space at different scales, providing valuable insights into human behavior and allowing for more accurate predictions and design decisions.

## Introduction 
This repository includes a sample Unity environment for generating necessary data for Visual Tracer based on Unity 2021.3.16f1.

## Usage
This repository needs to work with Visual Tracer grasshopper components.
1. Import this into Unity Editor
2. Click `Play` button or press `Ctrl+P` to run Unity sample file
3. Press `W,S,A,D` and `Space` to navigate the environment
4. Click `Stop` button or press `Ctrl+P` once again to stop running Unity
5. A `.stair` file will be saved at your desktop, load it by Visual Tracer Main to initialize Visual Tracer
